# Do you want to be good at English?
I'm going to the Australia in a month. so I have to learn English quickly.
I believe that I can learn to speak English for a little communication before I go there.
I've already subbitted the application form of my working holiday visa and paid only my money for it.
plz, I wish that I want will come true.
what if I didn't learn English? I don't want to think about this case.
When is there a chance, you have to catch it tightly and feel your youth.
I'll finish this project in a week and use it to study English.
